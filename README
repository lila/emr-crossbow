EMR-crossbow
----------------

simple example of Elastic Map Reduce bootstrap actions for installing crossbow

To use
======

see the makefile.  edit the variables at the top:

S3CMD                   = s3cmd
EMR			= elastic-mapreduce
CLUSTERSIZE		= 2 
REGION                  = us-east
KEY			= ${HOME}/.ssh/normal.pem
BUCKET			= s3://$(USER).crossbow.emr

requires that the elastic-mapreduce commandline tools, s3cmd and maven/java are all installed
and configured.  the above are paths, or make sure that the commands are in your PATH 
environment variable.

Prerequisites
=============

you need the following:
  - make
  - emr commandline tools (seem below for html link)
  - s3cmd (see below)

to run
======

---- stage the data from local machine to s3 ----

% make create

this will copy the data (scripts, jar files, etc) to a new bucket created on s3
and creates a new cluster as defined in the makefile.  It puts the jobflow id into a file
./jobflowid for later use.

  % make sshproxy

and then point your local browser to http://localhost:9100/

---- cleanup ----

don't forget to clean up

% make destroy

this will remove the s3 bucket and terminate the cluster.
